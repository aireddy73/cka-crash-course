# Setting up Gateway

The Gateway API CRDs do not ship with a Kubernetes cluster. You will have to install them yourself. Run the following command to install the stable release of the CRDs. See the [installation instructions](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/guides/#installing-gateway-api) for more information.

```
$ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/releases/download/v1.2.0/standard-install.yaml
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/gatewayclasses.gateway.networking.k8s.io created
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io created
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/grpcroutes.gateway.networking.k8s.io created
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/httproutes.gateway.networking.k8s.io created
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/referencegrants.gateway.networking.k8s.io created
```

You will now be able to list the CRDs.

```
$ kubectl get crd
NAME                                        CREATED AT
gatewayclasses.gateway.networking.k8s.io    2024-10-05T15:28:20Z
gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io          2024-10-05T15:28:20Z
grpcroutes.gateway.networking.k8s.io        2024-10-05T15:28:20Z
httproutes.gateway.networking.k8s.io        2024-10-05T15:28:20Z
referencegrants.gateway.networking.k8s.io   2024-10-05T15:28:21Z
```

You will have to [install a Gateway implementation](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/implementations/) in addition to the Gateway API CRDs. We'll use [Envoy Gateway](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/implementations/#envoy-gateway) for this example.
